# Software Design Patterns & Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture

## Description

This repository is for **learning and practicing software design patterns** with a strong focus on **Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA)**.

The goal is not to memorize patterns like Pokémon cards. The goal is to understand **why patterns exist**, **when to use them**, and **when not to**. Bad pattern usage is worse than no patterns at all.

This repository is a learning lab. Expect experiments, refactors, and comparisons between naive solutions and pattern-based solutions.

## What I’m Learning

### Design Patterns

- **Creational Patterns**
  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Builder

- **Structural Patterns**
  - Adapter
  - Decorator
  - Facade

- **Behavioral Patterns**
  - Strategy
  - Observer
  - Command

### Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA)

- Layered Architecture
- Client–Server
- Pipes and Filters
- Microkernel
- MVC / MVP / MVVM
- System-level separation of concerns

### Design Principles

- SOLID principles
- High cohesion, low coupling
- Composition over inheritance
- Managing trade-offs in real systems



## Why This Repository Exists

- To move beyond “code that works” to **code that scales and survives change**
- To understand **architectural decisions**, not just implementation details
- To build intuition for **real-world software design**, not interview trivia

## Disclaimer

Some implementations are intentionally simple or imperfect. This is deliberate. Learning happens through experimentation and refactoring, not blind copying of textbook examples.

## Status

🚧 Work in progress.  
Patterns and architectures are added incrementally as understanding deepens.
